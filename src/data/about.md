# Intro

I’m a Computer Science graduate with a passion for technology, AI, and solving real-world problems. Currently, I’m working on various projects ranging from blockchain solutions to AI-driven applications, always exploring the latest innovations.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing football, and staying active through the gym. Most importantly, I'm a good Muslim, always striving to become a better one. <br/><br />
If you have any questions about me or my projects,
or (politely) argue about who is better, Messi or Ronaldo?<br/> I'm your man!

# Some History

- My parents bought a laptop in 2006 when I was 3, while we were living in [Saudi Arabia](). It was an old Dell that ran Windows XP. Figuring out how to mute myself before my grandparents started asking about my grades on video calls (yes, I was that tech-savvy even as a kid).
- At 6, I remember bragging to my friends about having my Yahoo email ID.
- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
- At 13, I discovered HTML and made my first portfolio website—it was about myself because, well, I had no clients. Later, CSS taught me what not to do with colors (spoiler: it was an art crime).
- At 14, I found JavaScript. Couldn’t believe clicking a button could actually do stuff, it felt like Harry Potter!
- At 16, Built a chatbot on some drag-and-drop website I can’t even remember. Also skipped the usual 11th and 12th grades to dive headfirst into a diploma in Computer Engineering. Risky move? Definitely. Worth it? 100%.
- Also 16, when joined a summer camp at [Al Sadd FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sadd_SC) in Qatar and got selected for their team. Not just tech; I can kick too!
- At 17, I got distracted from technology. New college life and gangs took over (imagine coding getting replaced by chai, bunking classes, and laughing at bad jokes with friends).
- At 18, (The Great COVID Era) I entered the “Game from Home” phase. Played everything from GTA San Andreas Roleplay to Valorant to CS:GO. Somehow, between matches, I built an Examination Management System using C#, .NET, and MS Access. Why MS Access? Even I don’t know.
- At 19, I joined bachelor's college with big dreams of landing a job at Microsoft or Google. Spoiler alert: Didn’t happen.
- At 20, I got serious about life (finally). Switched dreams to pursuing a master’s degree in Computer Science in Germany. 
- At 21, I graduated and somehow managed to publish my first academic paper - turns out all those late-night coffee runs paid off!

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
